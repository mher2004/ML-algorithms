Armenian Armed Forces celebrate 28th anniversary of foundation,"YEREVAN, JANUARY 28, ARMENPRESS. The Republic of Armenia and Armenians around the world celebrate the 28th anniversary of foundation of the Armenian Armed Forces on January 28.The formation of the Armenian Armed Forces coincides with 1992-1994, when the newly independent Republic of Armenia, along with the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, being in undeclared but de facto war with Azerbaijan, simultaneously embarked on the creation of a national army. The Declaration of Independence of 1990, however, played a decisive role in the creation of the Armenian Army.On January 28, 1992, the Government adopted the historic decision titled “On the Defense Ministry of Armenia”, heralding the formation of the Armenian Armed Forces. In May of 1992, the Defense Ministry carried out the first drafting.The establishment of the Armenian Armed Forces passed through several stages. The first stage lasted from February 1988 to May 1992. In this period, ensuring the safety and security of the populations of Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh was more than pressing, as the Karabakh Movement became active and the Armenian-Azerbaijani relations escalated.The second stage, June 1992 – May 1994, when the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Nagorno Karabakh were in the crosshairs of the Azerbaijani aggression.The third stage began since June 1994 and continues to present day. During this period, significant works were carried out in the direction of improving the combat readiness of the troops, strengthening discipline, training of officers, Army-public relations etc.In September of 1990, the special regiment of Yerevan was formed, while five companies were established in Ararat, Goris, Vardenis, Ijevan and Meghri. In 1991, the Government approved the formation of the State Committee of Defense.Men aged 18-27 are subject to compulsory military service in Armenia for a two year period. Drafting is carried out twice a year – in winters and summers. In 2017 the Defense Ministry introduced “I am”, “I have honor” and “Outlook” service options.Since its establishment, the Armenian Armed Forces have cooperated and continue cooperating with international organizations.On May 15, 1992, Armenia became a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).Military cooperation with Russia has a great role in the international cooperation field of the Armenian Armed Forces. Russia is Armenia’s strategic partner and the defense cooperation between the states is on a high level.Cooperation with NATO is also expanding year by year.The Armenian Armed Forces greatly focus on training and educating highly skilled personnel. With this purpose, the Military aviation college was formed, which later transformed into the Military-Aviation institute, the Defense Ministry’s Command College was established – currently the Vazgen Sargsyan Military Institute, and the military-medical faculty of the Yerevan State Medical University.Graduates of the abovementioned institutions have continued trainings in foreign educational facilities. Namely, more than 1500 officers and cadets have trained and continue training in Russia and Greece.Armenian peacekeepers have a significant role in the history of the Armenian Armed Forces. Due to the peacekeepers, various countries around the world saw and appreciated the highly skilled and professional Armenian soldiers.On February 12, 2004, Armenia deployed a platoon-sized unit (three squads) to Kosovo to join the NATO peacekeeping mission as part of the Greek peacekeeping contingent.In 2005, Armenia deployed peacekeeping forces consisting of sappers, engineers and doctors to Iraq. The mission was on duty until 2009.Armenian servicemen are carrying out peacekeeping missions also in Afghanistan since 2010.Since November 26, 2014, Armenian peacekeepers are deployed in Lebanon, within the UNIFIL.In 2015, one peacekeeper was dispatched to Mali on a monitoring-peacekeeping mission.The Armenian Army is also the guarantor of security in the region. Imposed peace – this is a statement which in the recent period has started to be used more frequently due to frequent ceasefire violations.Being in favor of overcoming problems through dialogue, the Armenian Armed Forces are at the same time announcing that they are ready for any scenario."

Grigoryan that a certain mistake took place, however this isn’t a pattern as you can see from the abovementioned examples.Therefore, the rumors on the concealment of incidents by the Defense Ministry are completely unsubstantiated and I request you to refrain from manipulating the death news of servicemen when clarifying your personal or political issues,” Hovhannisyan wrote on Facebook.Earlier Defense Minister Davit Tonoyan also refuted the allegations on concealing fatalities in the military.Edited and translated by Stepan Kocharyan"

It was on the proposal of the Armenian President. In line with this I am also studying at the Law faculty of the Yerevan State University. This is a very important initiative. It provides great opportunities to soldiers who put their lives under danger during the military service.

And just like Vahagn, it too fought for freedom, for Fatherland, for victory.Our Army was created through the joint efforts, spirit, and willpower of our dedicated volunteers and professional servicemen, privates and commanders, state and political figures, intellectuals and workers, people of Artsakh and Armenians in Spyurk. In a short period of time, it became the most well-organized and combat-ready army in the region. We had multiple victories and legendary heroes.Allow me to express deep gratitude to all those in Armenia, Artsakh, and Spyurk who took part in the creation, maturing, and empowerment of our Army.I bow to the memory of those who sacrificed their lives for the Fatherland, for our country, our people, and the Army.Dear Compatriots,The Army of modern time, as a unique school and university of life should also bring up citizens of modern time, our boys and girls, and give them a start in life.Regardless of the type of service, regardless of one’s age, a serviceman acquires in the Army skills and experience, becomes more organized and disciplined. The Army is also the first contact with the state, and it is very important for that contact to be stimulating, inspiring hope and faith. The Army is truly the mirror of the society. If the society, the state undertakes steps to eliminate negative trends, to uproot them, it will most definitely be reflected first and foremost on the Army. The Army must be flawless, impeccable; serving in the Army must be not only a duty but also a great honor.I would like to thank the government and the Ministry of Defense for all steps taken in that direction.Dear Friends,The Army is not only the guarantor of the country’s security and peace but also an indivisible part of the economy. And it is not only a consumer but also a producer, a structure which can lead. For industry and science, the Army is a purchaser and also a participant of its advancement.Army sets tasks for the military industry and the areas of scientific research and anticipates contemporary and innovative, often also unexpected solutions which shouldn’t necessarily be replicas or copies of foreign solutions. We are capable of giving our own solutions to the problems.Many of the solutions from the military industry often are used in civil life. It means that Army is tasked to participate not only in the defense of the country but also in its economic development, closely cooperating with the scientific institutions, business circles and all citizens who are willing to make their contribution.Dear Fellow Citizens,A special attitude towards the Army and its soldiers is an inseparable part of our character. At all times, it has been the attitude of a special goodwill, care, consideration, and love. For me, this day carries a double pleasure: On the Fatherland Defender’s Day I would like to talk with you about a new initiative. The institute of the President of Armenia, presidential structure, together with the government, Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Health has designed a program which is called the Homeland Defender. The program is aimed to help those individuals who endangered their lives in the course of duty and became persons with disabilities. The number of such persons, patriots of our nation, unfortunately, in not small. There is no doubt that these persons not only deserve full respect and love but also deserve to continue to be part of our social, political, and economic life. Thus, the Homeland Defender program is aimed at assisting those servicemen who have become disabled in the course of their military service and at finding jobs for them. It means that the program will become a link between the individuals who served in the army and became disabled, the Army and other state, social, benevolent institutions and businesses. To set an example, we have undertaken a moral obligation to employ in the Presidential Administration in the nearest future two or three of our courageous servicemen with disabilities. Even though they might have certain physical limitations, each of them is a bright person and through the necessary support and educational program, they will be able to return to normal life, not just receive a pension but also be able to solve independently problems they face – from financial to personal.The “first swallow”, or rather the “first falcon” whom we have hired, is Gor Darmanian – a participant to the war, a hero, a disabled person who is working today at the Presidential Administration.I hope this example and appeal will inspire all our compatriots regardless of where they work – in the state sector, or private sector to engage them fully in our society.Dear Friends,I congratulate us all once again on the occasion of Army Day and wish health, peace, and new victories.Let yours and our people’s each morning be peaceful.Let our Fatherland’s each day be full of creative work. Thank you. Congratulations"".Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"
