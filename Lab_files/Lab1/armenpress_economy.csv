Estimations of Armenia’s economic growth are pretty solid compared to neighbors – World Bank,"YEREVAN, JANUARY 9, ARMENPRESS. According to the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects January 2020 report the estimations of Armenia’s economic growth are pretty solid at this stage, reports Armenpress.“According to the World Bank Global Economic Prospects (#GEP) January 2020 report, growth in the South Caucasus is forecast to decelerate, however estimations of Armenia’s economic growth are pretty solid at this stage. In particular, the forecast of growth for 2020 is 5.1%, while for 2021-2022 – 5.2% accordingly”, the report says.According to the report “firming growth in the South Caucasus, to an estimated 3.7 percent in 2019, was supported by private consumption, and on the supply side by strong manufacturing growth, as well as by a recovery in mining production in Armenia”.Regional growth is expected to firm over the forecast horizon, to 2.6 percent in 2020 and 2.9 percent in 2021-22, on the assumptions that key commodity prices and growth in the Euro Area stabilize, and that Turkey’s economy recovers from earlier financial pressures and Russia firms on the back of policy support (Figure 2.2.2.A). Considerable variation across economies is expected to continue. Economies in Central Europe are anticipated to slow as fiscal policy support wanes and demographic pressures persist, while those in Central Asia are projected to continue growing at a robust pace, and more rapidly than previously envisaged, on the back of structural reform progress, the report said."

EAEU expands geography of free trade deals: Armenian products become competitive in many countries,"YEREVAN, DECEMBER 24, ARMENPRESS. The Eurasian Economic Union is expanding the geography of its free trade agreements with the third countries as new deals are expected to be signed next year. The goods of Armenian production will have a price advantage in the markets of countries that have such agreements compared to the similar goods produced in another countries, Deputy Minister of Economy of Armenia Varos Simonyan said in an interview to ARMENPRESS.“2019, the year of Armenia’s chairmanship at the Union, was quite active. During Armenia’s chairmanship two major free trade agreements were signed with Singapore and Serbia. This year two more agreements also entered into force: the free trade deal with Iran and the agreement on economic cooperation with China. In other words, the EAEU has 4 new agreements. This, of course, means new markets. Currently negotiations are underway also with Egypt, Israel and India”, Simonyan said, adding that India is a big market with a great position in the region.The deputy minister informed that the Eurasian Economic Commission signs an agreement with a third country only after taking into account the opinions of the EAEU member states. All decisions are made exclusively via consensus, taking into account the interests of each of the member states.“The EAEU signs new agreements with the third countries aimed at ensuring access to new markets, affordable markets, providing privileged conditions. The EAEU is a big market, and the third countries also want to enter that market. The EAEU continues taking actions to further deepen and develop the ties with the third countries, at the same time ensuring the affordability of the market”, he said, adding that the free trade agreements suppose decline of customs duties up to 0%. After the agreement enters into force customs duties of some goods are reduced, and then a certain order is set for others. The deputy minister said the reduction of customs duty forms privileged competitive conditions for those countries which do not have a free trade deal with a concrete country. “Let’s suppose that Armenia is producing a good that is demanded in the third country with which the EAEU has a free trade agreement, and the import to that country is carried out with a zero customs duty. In that case, the goods produced in Armenia will have a price advantage in the market with the amount of the customs duty against a similar good produced in another country which doesn’t have a free trade deal with that third country. In other words, we provide a competitive advantage to our local producers”, he said.The free trade deals, however, are not limited only to the reduction of the customs duties. These agreements also contribute to elimination of some technical barriers for trade. The Armenian deputy economy minister said in the coming years the EAEU can sign new agreements with the third countries. For instance, a memorandum of understanding was signed with Chile which is the first phase of the cooperation, and the second phase will be the signing of the free trade agreement. At the moment Chile is working with all member states of the Union for launching talks on free trade agreement. But if any of the Union’s member states opposes this, the agreement will not be signed with the third country.Given the aforementioned we view the EAEU as an integration tool that enables Armenia to diversify the export markets by using the privileged terms granted by the free trade agreements.As for the Iran-EAEU free trade deal, the deputy minister said the latter entered into force on October 27. After the agreement entered into force customs duties of a group of products were reduced but not to zero. “The imported goods are not for Armenia only, that is an import to the EAEU market. The crossing border is Armenia’s border, some goods can be imported, but they all are not for the economy of Armenia only or for the consumption in the Armenian market. And in this sense Armenia can be viewed as a platform for the expansion of Iran-EAEU and Iran-other countries economic cooperation”, the Armenian deputy minister said.Interview by Anna GrigoryanEdited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

WB Group to help attract investments and empower women entrepreneurs in Armenia,"YEREVAN, DECEMBER 5, ARMENPRESS. The World Bank Group, in partnership with the United Kingdom’s Good Governance Fund, is launching a new advisory program in Armenia to help the government implement reforms, attract foreign direct investment (FDI), and foster female entrepreneurship to spur business growth and job creation, ARMENPRESS was informed from WB member International Financial Corporation.Since 2008, attracting FDI to Armenia has been challenging due to the global economic crisis, the recession in Russia—the country’s main trading partner—and regulatory and institutional issues. Armenia also faces disparities between women and men in entrepreneurship, reducing economic output to an equivalent of 14 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The two-year program—titled Economic Growth and the Economic Empowerment of Women in Armenia—will be implemented by IFC, a member of the World Bank Group. The program will work in two directions: it will advise the government on attracting FDI through targeted investment promotion and measures to improve investor confidence; and it will help improve the economic outcomes of women entrepreneurs by improving their business competencies and access to business networks.Tigran Khachatryan, Armenia's Minister of Economy, said: “I congratulate all of us for the launch of this advisory program in Armenia. We appreciate the support of our international partners in such important areas as the improvement of the business environment and investment promotion, where they can help us formulate the Government’s reform agenda. We are committed to continuing reforms to provide new opportunities for private sector growth in the country.”Ambassador David Moran, British Chargé d'Affaires to Armenia, said: “The UK is pleased to support this project through our Good Governance Fund. It will help the Armenian Government in its work to improve the enabling environment for business and encourage investment to stimulate economic growth. Particularly important is the focus on the economic empowerment of women—a goal at the heart of the UK’s approach to development.”IFC’s advice will support the growth of high-potential sectors, including identifying promising sectors for targeted FDI promotion. The project will help strengthen relevant legal and regulatory frameworks and help the government identify export potential for selected products. To ensure that women entrepreneurs can benefit from business environment reforms, the project will also help analyze key constraints for women in business and build capacity of women entrepreneurs. “Higher private sector productivity boosts growth and job creation. Investment climate reforms are key to encouraging private sector development and empower women entrepreneurs,” said Jan van Bilsen, IFC Regional Manager for the South Caucasus. “We will work with Armenia’s government to help ease doing business here as part of the World Bank Group’s broader effort to help Armenia create a more competitive investment climate.” Since Armenia became an IFC member and shareholder, IFC has supported projects in the country totaling around $700 million, mainly in energy, the financial sector, property, and manufacturing."

World Bank to provide new US $50 million loan to Armenia,"WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 22, ARMENPRESS. The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved on November 21 a new, EUR 45.8 million (US $50 million) loan for the Armenia Governance Development Policy Operation (DPO), a budget support operation, the World Bank told Armenpress.The operation supports the government’s actions to strengthen economic, fiscal, and public sector governance by: improving pro-competition, pro-trade and streamlined quality regulations and processes; enhancing efficiency of revenue mobilization and public investment and strengthening anti-corruption initiatives and the performance of the justice sector and the civil service.The new lending comes on the heels of the widespread protests against weak governance and corruption in 2018 that culminated with the peaceful and historic “Velvet” Revolution. The newly elected government, armed with a strong mandate for change, has put forward an ambitious five-year reform program, which aims to improve competitiveness and spur economic growth while meeting the people’s demands for good governance, greater transparency, accountability and effective public services.“This operation prioritizes core governance reforms, initial steps which set the foundations for longer-term reforms in a number of areas,” says Sylvie Bossoutrot, World Bank Country Manager for Armenia. “It is anchored in the 2019–23 government program and the Bank’s Country Partnership Framework for 2019–23, which highlight governance as a cross-cutting foundation. It focuses on those areas where strategic relevance, impact, and reform sustainability are high and where it can support building blocks for deeper change.”Market competition, for example, is targeted through interventions to introduce a state aid control framework, develop a more transparent and rule-based tax administration system, strengthen the quality and efficiency of laws and regulations, and institute efficient and risk-based custom management.Fiscal consolidation and expenditure efficiency are supported by measures to improve tax administration and establish a sounder public investment management system. Improved public sector governance would be strengthened by supporting a package of anti-corruption measures and enhancing the performance of the justice sector and civil service.“A comprehensive assessment by the Bank identified the lack of a state aid-control framework as one of the key impediments to healthy competition in Armenia. Measures to promote competitive neutrality in the granting of state aid and incentives have not yet been put in place to level the playing field, foster market contestability, and prevent previously informal advantages provided to some firms from being replaced by formalized advantages,” says Genevieve Boyreau, World Bank Task Team Leader of the Project.As part of the World Bank’s global commitment to climate change mitigation and adaptation, this operation will also support the assessment of the climate change impact of new regulations, as part of the implementation of a Regulatory Impact Assessment Framework. It will thus enable policymakers to make decisions informed by qualitative and quantitative assessment of the climate change impact of each new regulation and mainstream climate change adaptation and mitigation measures into legislative and regulatory packages.The EUR 45.8 million (about US $50 million) is an IBRD loan of fixed spread, with a 14.5-year grace period and a total repayment term of 25.5 years.Since joining the World Bank in 1992 and IDA in 1993, commitments to Armenia have totaled approximately US $2,429,734 million."

Unprecedented growth in export of Armenian wines recorded - National Institute of Standards,"YEREVAN, NOVEMBER 14, ARMENPRESS. The National Institute of Standards and the National Institute of Metrology are merged into one structure. Based on the Armenian government’s decision, that structure will be called a National Body for Standardization and Metrology CJSC.Acting Director of the National Institute of Standards and the National Institute of Metrology Albert Babayan told a press conference in Armenpress that the merger of these two structures is aimed at making their activities more effective.“Thanks to the merger it would be possible to optimally use the material database, the resources existing in the two structures. As a result the maintenance costs of both structures will be saved and directed for raising the efficiency of their operation”, he said. Babayan said the structure is going to carry out major works to upgrade the old standards, the metrology database and intensify the cooperation with the business. “Armenia is an EAEU member, and the demands for quality are defined by single procedures”, he said.As for the outdated standards, Albert Babayan said they have demands set by inter-state standards which have not been revised since 1994. “This year we have carried out works to develop standards and later include them in the EAEU technical regulations. Based on the proposal of manufacturers and NGOs we have developed a standard for fruit vodka with a view to reflect the qualitative demands of our producers in a right way. The technical regulation on alcoholic drinks will enter into force in 2021 and we will try to include the standard developed by us in that regulation in order to guarantee the interests of our producers in the EAEU space as much as possible”, he said.Albert Babayan highlighted the activeness of the business. He said they want to develop a culture for the business to be active, come up with proposals for developing standards and be engaged in that development process.Every year the government holds award ceremony in the field of quality. Those companies, whose works have been evaluated by the working group of the National Institute of Standards and the agency, are being selected. This year 10 companies representing food industry, healthcare, beverages production will be awarded.Babayan said according to the recent trends, the number of business companies operating in Armenia in accordance with the standards has increased. Thanks to these standards the business organizes its production more effectively, along with also being competitive. This year the introduction of the ISO international standard was unprecedented which speaks about the activeness of the export process. This year an unprecedented growth in the export of wines to the EU states has been registered. Last year 221 thousand bottles of wine were exported from Armenia to the EU, but according to the results of 10 months of this year, this number is 281 thousand.Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"
Armenia can aim for several billion-dollar export activities by attracting more investment - UNCTAD,"YEREVAN, NOVEMBER 13, ARMENPRESS. Armenia can aim for billion-dollar export sales over the next 10 to 20 years in several activities that, if properly leveraged through effective investment promotion, could help concretize the economic revolution promised by the country’s authorities, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Commission on Investment, Enterprise and Development said in its Investment Policy Review (IPR) of Armenia.The IPR was prepared after President of Armenia Armen Sarkissian’s visit to Switzerland.Sarkissian visited Switzerland in 2018 and met with UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi and proposed the UNCTAD to prepare the IPR of Armenia. The UNCTAD team traveled to Armenia in 2019 with this purpose.In 2019 Sarkissian and Kituyi met again, this time at the UN Headquarters. The Armenian president thanked the UNCTAD and the Secretary General for initiating the preparation of the report.During the presentation of the report on November 12th, UNCTAD’s director of investment and enterprise, James Zhan, stressed that the IPR, which was undertaken at the request of the president of Armenia, takes into account comparative advantages and constraints. It makes recommendations to develop an export-led growth through efficiency-seeking FDI.Beyond measures to tap the export potential through investment, the IPR includes the broader policy objective of promoting inclusive growth and sustainable development. It underlines specific measures for spreading benefits to the country’s regions, creating employment and linkages with local suppliers, including by moving to full package manufacture in the textiles and garments industry, and extending benefits of tourism to areas outside the capital Yerevan.The IPR also shows ways to deepen the high-technology sector and make Armenia a leading hub for innovation, data science and artificial intelligence. It outlines how to extend research and development capability in the pharmaceutical industry to transform a small generics industry into larger-scale manufacturing.Investment in the target industries can come from a mix of sources, including domestic, FDI and joint ventures, and the diaspora, Armenia’s key competitive advantage, will continue to play a key role, the IPR says.“Our country is ripe for an economic revolution based on high-tech and innovative activities and we are working to modernize the business environment,” said Armenia’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Andranik Hovhannisyan. “Timing for investment in Armenia is now both right and ripe,” added the country’s United Nations resident coordinator, Shombi Sharp."
EEC plans to eliminate most of the barriers existing in EAEU before 2025,"YEREVAN, NOVEMBER 13, ARMENPRESS. The Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) plans to eliminate by 2025 those parts of the 71 barriers existing in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) which relate to the privileges granted to the Union’s member states, Karine Minasyan - Member of the Board, Minister in charge of Internal Markets, Information Support, Information & Communication Technologies at the EEC, told Armenpress.“Currently we have 71 barriers and are working in all directions. The problem is that most of these barriers are defined by law, these are the so-called exceptions granted to the countries by law. And now we are raising an issue to eliminate these exceptions. Now the question will be put also at the presidents level that all exceptions granted to the states during the talks should be eliminated before 2025”, the EEC Minister said, adding that they are going to solve the issue of elimination of exceptions before 2025.She also considered problematic the existing nearly 20 obstacles connected with the legislative gaps. As a result of these gaps the national markets in the Union sometimes are closed for the remaining participants. These 20 obstacles relate to the fact that the national legislations are not in accordance with the supra-national legislation, the treaty. “In other words, a violation is recorded in the countries which we reveal and propose the states to eliminate that obstacle”, she said.However, she also noted that in the past 3 years nearly 40 such barriers have been eliminated, but this is a continuous process. Karine Minasyan said various problems emerge, most of which are linked with the sale and purchase of food.Touching upon the issues related to Armenia, the EEC Minister assured that they are solving all issues which the Armenian government addresses to the Commission.Interview by Anna GrigoryanEdited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

EEC takes actions to make the fight against counterfeit products effective – minister,"YEREVAN, NOVEMBER 12, ARMENPRESS. The Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) is carrying out major works to raise the quality and efficiency of the fight against the spread of fake products, Timur
Zhaksylykov,Member of the Board – Minister in charge of Economy and Financial Policy at the EEC, said in an interview to ARMENPRESS.-Mr. Zhaksylykov, today the 7th Anticontrafact International Forum is being held in Armenia. How do you assess such format discussions on issues relating to the circulation of counterfeit products?-We are holding this forum since 2012, and starting from that times it became a platform for discussing the issues on circulation of fake products. We are also dealing with the intellectual property rights issues. Here the representatives of the leadership, the business and science, as well as others exchange views and present proposals. The format of this forum is very unique because such platforms are not so much in the world where issues about the fake products are being discussed.-The number of fake products in the Eurasian Economic Union is gradually growing. What is the reason? How the member states of the Union are going to solve this issue?-The increase in number of fake products doesn’t only relate to us, it is a widespread issue all over the world. According to the data of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development this year the circulation of fake goods in the world will comprise more than 500 billion USD. This is equal to the 3% of the global import. Several years ago this figure was low. On the one hand, the production of fake goods increases in the EAEU, they are also imported from abroad in a large quantity. And on the other hand, the level of fight against fake increases. In recent years the fast growth of these goods is also thanks to the online purchases. Today we are going to discuss the effective approaches for the fight against fake products which are already being successfully used. The close cooperation and work within the EAEU is very important for us.-What mechanisms are there in the EAEU for the protection of intellectual property rights? How do the countries fight smuggling?-Russia is doing quite well in the fight against the spread of counterfeit goods via online shopping. We have seen how several similar websites have been blocked. However, I think there is still a lot to learn in this regard, and the Commission needs to take actions on this direction.Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

‘Armenian government implements open-door policy towards foreign investments’ – PM Pashinyan,"YEREVAN, OCTOBER 25, ARMENPRESS. The Armenian government implements an open-door policy towards foreign investments, providing for full property ownership, PM Nikol Pashinyan told Gulf News in an interview.“Armenia provides an excellent opportunity for investors in areas such as information technology, tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, energy and many others”, he said. “Our government implements an open-door policy towards foreign investments, providing for full property ownership. Foreign investors can have free access to any sector and geographic location within the country with no restrictions on personnel recruitment, free and unlimited repatriation of profits, unlimited currency exchange on market rates, and guarantees against nationalization. The five-year grandfather clause protecting foreign investors against investment-related legislation changes is also a part of our foreign investment framework. With regard to international economic relations, Armenia has bilateral treaties on investment promotion and protection with 43 countries, including the United States. Armenia is a member of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. We have treaties on the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with 46 countries. This means that the investors are granted a number of guarantees – in particular, national treatment, protection from expropriation, free transfer of means and full protection and security”.Pashinyan noted that the World Bank has ranked Armenia 41st out of 190 countries in its Doing Business report.“In terms of ease of starting a business, Armenia is 8th in the world, and 14th for registering a property. According to the Index of Economic Freedom, Armenia is the 47th freest economy in the world. We are continuing to carry out deep and comprehensive reforms to improve our business environment. The government is working on legislative reforms to establish a most-favoured-nation regime to define the guarantees provided for foreign investors, as well as to introduce effective dispute settlement mechanisms. We are currently working on expanding opportunities and clearly defining the legal framework for public-private partnerships.
“Armenia is a small, landlocked country” is a description that you may find in many books and articles. Well, I agree, we are a small country. But, we are a nation with a wide and global network, which makes us great. Armenia is located in a place that bridges cultures and economies. Some may claim that Armenia has a small market, but I am here to challenge that view. Armenia is a part of the Eurasian Economic Union market that has over 180 million consumers. Armenian producers also benefit from GSP+ preferential treatment with the European Union, and GSP with the United States and some other countries. Armenia is also deepening cooperation with the European Union through a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement. This ambitious agreement provides a framework for Armenia and the EU to work together for the benefit of the citizens of Armenia in the areas of strengthening democracy and human rights, creating more jobs and business opportunities, fairer rules, more safety and security, a cleaner environment, as well as better education and opportunities for research”, the Armenian Prime Minister said.In response to a question regarding the reduction of the number of ministries, the PM said there were simple reasons for doing so. “One of the goals of our reform agenda is the optimization of public administration and the establishment of more efficient and less costly government institutions. Reduction of the number of ministries will help us meet this goal and enhance the efficiency of our government.”He said that the reforms in Armenia are long-term and strategic, and therefore the economic revolution will have a long-lasting effect on the country’s economic development and people’s lives.“Meanwhile, let me share some already recorded results with you. In 2018, we registered a 5.2% economic growth rate and maintained a moderate inflation rate. These are very positive results for a year that saw a revolution. We have also had a 9% increase in exports. The positive dynamics are continuing this year with 6.5% growth recorded in the first half of the year. In August 2019, Moody’s upgraded Armenia’s credit rating to “Ba3”. These results are promising; however, there is much more that needs to be done.”"
"Investors’ interest towards Armenia grows, economists say","YEREVAN, OCTOBER 21, ARMENPRESS. Improvement of Armenia’s economic growth forecasts by several leading international organizations is a good signal, Economist Inga Ghalayan told a press conference in ARMENPRESS, stating that the improvement of indicators is connected with a number of factors.“They firstly view the country’s domestic situation, see what policy is being carried out. They also consider the fight against the shadow, corruption, the tax reforms, in addition they also notice that the inflationary pressures are lacking and the most important is that stability is being recorded in Armenia’s financial market. As you know, the World Bank has raised our competitiveness index”, she said.Introducing the data released by international organizations, the economist said the World Bank’s current forecast for Armenia’s economic growth is 5.5% compared to the 4.2% of the past. The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast is 6% against the 4.6% of the past. These organizations also touched upon the poverty and unemployment rate in Armenia. According to the World Bank forecast, the poverty rate in Armenia will drop, becoming 7% by 2021, and the IMF’s forecast is that the unemployment rate will decline comprising 17.5%. In addition to these two major structures, Armenia also improved its positions in the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) forecast which predicts 4.8% growth. In this context the economist attached importance to the Central Bank’s forecast according to which the year will end by 6.9% economic growth.My Step faction MP Artak Manukyan said Armenia is among those unique countries over which forecast has been made in terms of improving the economic indicators.“If we look at the global trends and the developments we will see that all these structures have more negative forecasts. US-China possible trade wars, certain negative trends in various regions, nearly 3% development is predicted at the global level. But we see that Armenia has further improved its positions”, he said. According to the economist, the certain decline in demand in foreign markets will be easily passed by the countries where services are more important. He said the developing countries have a greater opportunity to record a bigger economic growth for these same investments rather than the developed countries because here there is a great potential which is not utilized. The economist highlighted the fact that in 2019 Armenia’s progressive growth rates are faster than the average prediction in the world.“We have a non-utilized potential and our prime minister constantly says that double-digit economic growth is not a myth, but for this it’s very important for us to create preconditions, but this will be difficult without investments in infrastructures”, Artak Manukyan said.In her turn Inga Ghalayan said these forecasts of international organizations are an important signal for investments. Moody’s recently also raised its assessment over Armenia. Based on this Armenia managed to release Eurobonds at a low interest rate – 4.2%. She said after the distribution of the Eurobonds it became clear how big the demand is, and this in turn speaks about the interest of investors towards Armenia.Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

Export from Armenia to EAEU grows at higher rate than overall export on average,"YEREVAN, OCTOBER 14, ARMENPRESS. The export from Armenia to the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) grows at a higher rate than the overall export on average. In the first 8 months of this year the export to the EAEU states grew by 11% compared to the same period of 2018, but the overall export volume from Armenia increased by 4.6%, Minister of Economy Tigran Khachatryan said during a press conference, noting that, however, the EAEU entire resource is not utilized yet.“In 2018 we have exported goods to the EAEU member states by 20% more compared to 2017. In the 8 months of 2019, we have exported goods to the EAEU states by 11% more than in the same period of 2018, despite the fact that the overall export of goods increased by 4.6%. This means that the export in other directions has not decreased, but a lower growth has been registered”, the minister said.He stated that Armenia exports more to the EAEU states, and the volumes are growing rapidly with the power of a single customs union. But not all problems are solved, there are objective restrictions. “Businessmen frequently raise the issue why the Armenian exporters at the Lars checkpoint should be subject to the same customs clearance rules that cars from any third party departing for Russia are subject to. And this is a very sensitive issue. We have not yet utilized the whole EAEU resource. And all the benefits that can exist are still ahead, we are working on this path”, the minister said.He assured that they already have an agreement, a perception by partners that they should think about mechanisms which will ensure that these procedures are more simplified.Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

Economy minister warns against “unfair” Amulsar decision jeopardizing Armenia’s investment future,"YEREVAN, AUGUST 28, ARMENPRESS. Minister of Economy Tigran Khachatryan believes that an “unfair” solution to the Amulsar project issue can jeopardize the future of investments in Armenia.On August 19th, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced that the Government intends to allow Lydian International to continue the Amulsar project. The decision was based on the conclusion of an environmental audit conducted by ELARD. Pashinyan emphasized that the project will be operated strictly in adherence to high environmental standards.But on August 21 the PM requested the Ministry of Environment to study the conclusion and determine whether or not another Environmental Impact Assessment is required before a final decision is made.The Amulsar Project is a gold mining project by Lydian Armenia, the Armenian subsidiary of Lydian International.In an interview with ARMENPRESS Khachatryan spoke about the gold mine’s potential exploitation, its economic advantages, environmental risks and their mitigation actions and other issues.Mr. Minister, there’s a lot of talk about the environmental risks of the exploitation of the Amulsar gold mine. The part of the society which is opposing the mine’s operation claim that it can inflict damage to Lake Sevan and Jermuk waters. After all, if indeed these harmful impacts exist, to what extent is it expedient to operate the mine?During all these months the Government has stated as a principled position that during its [potential] activities the project shouldn’t have the kind of environmental negative impacts which is in unacceptable limits from the society’s perspective. The discussion’s conclusion hints that this kind of an impact doesn’t exist. Experts, in turn, are reassuring that the preventive actions which the company must carry out during operations rule out any negative omissions into the environment.If nevertheless the mine won’t be operated, to what extent will this harm Armenia’s international reputation?If an unfair decision is made it will impact the reputation. The most important issue is the issue of fairness, whether the Government of Armenia and the society are treating fairly those investors who have made decisions in conditions of having certain rights. During the previous year we have explained everyone the motives we had for waiting for a final conclusion, and it was the concern that the project has the kind of environmental risks in the existence of which we would have to explain everyone that we can’t continue that way. The conclusion states that these kinds of risks don’t exist. Meaning, I still believe that we have been able to manage also the international opinion on the important grounds that in the end we will make a fair decision. When it is recorded as a fact that the opinion on risks not being present is a final one, I think we will overcome the temporary tension which existed among international investors. We must be coherent in order for the confidence which exists for the Armenian Government’s decisions and economic future to remain high.How much will be the economic income from the potential operations of the Amulsar gold mine?Lydian has estimated that in the limits of the confirmed reserves it can work for ten years, and it can reprocess around 10 million tons of ore each year. These are the quantitative figures which have been acknowledged by authorities and based on which the respective exploitation permits were granted. Meaning, we have activities estimated for around 10 years, exploitation of 10 million tons of ore each year, nearly 250 million dollars of products calculated by 1200 dollars and exports. If gold prices remain the same as today, then as a result of this mine’s exploitation nearly 300 million dollars worth of products will be created yearly.Asked about the workplaces that the operations will create, the minister said the potential exploitation of the mine will open 750 direct jobs, and 4 times more indirect workplaces which will be directly or indirectly linked with servicing the production. “There will be nearly 3800 jobs totally”.Edited and translated by Stepan Kocharyan"

I want to state that we had a 15% growth in export in May compared to May 2018, and 0.1% growth in January-May compared to January-May 2018 which means that we have overcome the export-related issues this year.

These are just signs, but very important signs that the economy and the business community have perceived the political messages of the government. And two days ago we had a working discussion on the medium-term expenditure programs and based on this discussion results we have recorded that it’s very important for these messages to be perceived also in the public administration system, and this system should also work with the logic the structure of the economic activity index hints us today.

The talk concerns all spheres of state power, including legislative, executive, judicial, local self-government, and I think this is our most important action of the future”, the PM added.Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

Armenian PM says citizens should be confident that they get maximum efficiency and quality,"YEREVAN, JUNE 5, ARMENPRESS. The government and the political majority of Armenia have put a task before themselves not to lose the balance in all areas, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said at the joint session of the parliamentary standing committees during the discussion of the 2018 state budget performance report.“It was possible to maintain the macroeconomic stability for two main reasons. Firstly, we should praise the fact that there are certain developed institutions in Armenia which played a role during the period of the velvet revolution and showed that regardless of upheavals they can maintain the normal operation of the state system, this is a very good news. The second one is the essence of the velvet revolution which has been criticized for many times. There are many talks according to which “velvet is too much” in the political changes that have taken place, that the revolution should have been much tougher, of course it could and can be, but the feature is that the government cannot put a task to solve only one problem, because it needs to solve many problems”, he said, adding that if the balance of anyone is violated, that will lead to collapse in other areas.In this regard the PM assured that the government and the political majority have put a task not to lose the balance in any field.He highlighted the fact that they are fully committed to the values they have declared during the peaceful democratic revolution. The introduction of the values of this revolution in Armenia has been and still remains a task for the government. Pashinyan said violence-free atmosphere has been created in the country, adding that any manifestation of hatred has no place in Armenia and should not have.“In fact we have not only overfulfilled the goals of the economic growth put by the former government, but also ours. There were many criticisms last year regarding the goals of the economic growth. And we said that time that the goal is conservative, but, of course, are goals are much more. And I am happy to record that based on this balanced policy we have a 7.1% GDP growth rate in the first quarter. This is not the economic activity index, but the summed up GDP rate”, Pashinyan said, stating that 9.2% growth in economic activity index has been registered in April.PM considers this a result of a joint work, government-parliament, also with the opposition partners.He informed that nothing extraordinary have taken place in the digital parts of the budget, there has been a shortcoming in expenditure parts. The expenditures planned for 2018 were impossible to be implemented completely. “This is linked with several problems, including the fight against corruption. Today as well there are major loan projects over which criminal cases have been launched, and we believe the state budget resources, including the loan resources, should be spent maximally effective, and the citizens of Armenia should be confident that they get the maximum efficiency and quality they can expect”, he added.Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

A month ago we had a working discussion over the situation with the export, there were some concerns, but I am happy that we have already recorded 9.9% growth in April”, he said, adding that there is a certain positive dynamics in the increase of average monthly nominal salaries.“I think this dynamics will become more positive in the context of the decisions announced”, the PM added.Armenia’s economic activity indexes according to sectorsEdited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

"Ruling faction lawmakers propose to raise minimum salary, setting it 63.000 drams","YEREVAN, MAY 24, ARMENPRESS. MPs of the ruling My Step faction of the Armenian Parliament Varazdat Karapetyan and Babken Tunyan propose to raise the minimum salary by 8000 drams, setting it 63.000 drams instead of the current 55.000 drams. This will reach the minimum salary to the minimum consumer basket.Lawmaker Varazdat Karapetyan introduced the purpose and details of the bill on making changes in the Law on Minimum Monthly Salary in an interview to ARMENPRESS.“These 8.000 drams will not change a lot for many families, but by this we will at least make the salary closer to the minimum consumer basket so that the people would be able to ensure a minimum standard of living for themselves. When we were holding pre-election meetings in provinces, in particular with the employees of the non-commercial community organizations, the most important issue which was raised was the amount of the minimum salary. From these meetings, also due to the fact that many jobs emerge from the shadow which is accompanied by reflecting the amount of the real salary, we understood that it’s time to increase the minimum nominal salary”, he said.In the initial version of the bill they have discussed raising the minimum salary up to 65.000 drams, but MP Karapetyan said in case of such an increase the coefficients would change, therefore the option of 63.000 drams was selected. According to him, this is just the first small step. The lawmaker believes that the minimum salary should be at least 120.000 drams within the next 4-5 years and states that he is going to constantly work on this path.According to the data provided by the State Revenue Committee, the number of people working full-time with up to 81.820 drams salary, including taxes, doesn’t exceed 45.000, 8.400 of whom work in the public sector and 6.000 in the non-commercial community organizations. In case of the adoption of the bill the people’s salaries will increase by an average of 6.270 drams. These changes will require nearly 840 million AMD additional expenditures from the state budget, and 392 million drams from the community budget. Overall, the allocations for the salary both in the private and public sectors will comprise around 3.46 billion drams.The lawmaker assures that the change will not have a significant impact on the state budget. “We are raising the salaries of the people who receive wages from the budget system, but the private sector will also raise the salaries. And thus, more entries of the income tax will cover the state budget expenditure”, he said.The increase of salaries both in the private and public sector will comprise 3.46 billion drams, from which 0.8 billion drams will be returned to the state treasury as an income tax. As a result of the increase, the difference between the salaries in public and private sector will also be cut.As for the additional expenditure on the community budget, Karapetyan said people in the communities must receive normal salaries. “The community leaders should refuse from the old practice by keeping employees with a minimum salary who later must have given their votes to the companies. And the gradual increase of the minimum salary will be accompanied also by this process so that the local self-government bodies will understand that it’s better to have one normal specialist”, he said.Karapetyan said if the bill is debated and adopted, they will come up with an initiative to raise the minimum salary every year.Interview by Anna GrigoryanEdited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

Government’s task is to do so that no one will need the government for conducting economic activity,"ARTASHAT, MAY 4, ARMENPRESS. Individual effort must be put on the basis of the economic revolution. No opportunity of the citizen of Armenia is limited for creative, legal changes and actions, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said in his remarks during the My Step For Ararat Province investment-business forum launched today in Artashat town.“The economic changes, which are taking place in Armenia and will take place in the future as well, are an absolute priority for us. I want to state that the most important precondition for the economic changes is the ideology that is put on their basis. We call this idea an individual effort, change of an individual. Before the revolution the philosophy and ideology were the following: what can the citizen of Armenia do? We all know the answer of this question: the citizen of Armenia, in fact, couldn’t do anything or if he could do something, it was in a limited way, moreover, with a certain permission and sponsorship. But after the revolution the citizen can do everything, no opportunity of the citizen is limited, with a condition that we are talking about creative, legal changes and actions when people use their own freedoms and exercise them”, the PM said, adding that the change of this philosophy made Armenia today one of the world’s leading democratic countries, makes now and should make Armenia one of the world’s economically developed countries.“Today no citizen in Armenia is restricted with something. However, many inertial processes of the past still hinder: people sometimes do not want to believe in what they see, hear, they sometimes continue having the need of agreements, and most of the people who have a desire for any economic investment want to personally meet and agree with the country’s leadership. Of course, we are ready to meet, but, we also need to understand that the day consists of 24 hours, and the week of 7 days. This inertia of the past hinders us today”, the PM noted.Addressing the businessmen, Pashinyan said the government’s main task is to do so that no one will need the government for conducting an economic activity. “Our mission is for the people to have the need of government as little as possible in their daily life. The main task of the government is not to lead the people, not to hinder the people, not to form their will, but to encourage the people, develop their creative skills and abilities”, Pashinyan said, adding that today there are already dozens examples in this sense.“My Step For Ararat Province” investment-business forum has kicked off on May 4 in Ararat Group water company of Artashat town.Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

It is difficult to imagine that the signaled economic revolution in Armenia will succeed if we will not be able to encourage women’s entrepreneurship,” the PM said.PM Nikol Pashinyan expressed hope that women’s role in the economic revolution will be equally decisive and important and called on all women in Armenia to make their step also in the economic revolution.“I am sure that women can be more effective in entrepreneurship and they have an ability to move forward with more prudent, balanced and substantiated steps,” the PM said, hoping that soon the involvement of women in Armenian politics and economy will grow.Edited and translated by Stepan Kocharyan"

Pashinyan attaches importance to establishment of working relations between government and expert community,"YEREVAN, APRIL 22, ARMENPRESS. The government of Armenia and the expert community of various fields, especially economics, should cooperate, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said at the meeting with the students and teaching staff of the YSU Faculty of Economics and Management, attaching importance to the development of expert institutions in Armenia.“It’s very important to understand how the relations between the government and the economical community should be built. Today there is a vision of an economic model which received a trust mandate from the citizens of Armenia, and the economics community must present its vision with its approaches and proposals on how to implement this model. Without political vision no economical discussion receives a final meaning. The important is that we have received a mandate from the citizens to implement this task, and the most important is for us to be able to establish constructive relations with the economical society for effectively implementing this mandate”, the PM said.He noted that the economic processes should develop within a certain political vision and stated that their vision has not proved its truthfulness because there is no vision in the world which proved its truthfulness by 100%.The PM assured that the government has taken a political responsibility for implementing this model, has received a mandate from the people, and the relations with the economical community should be built within this logic. “The greatest problem with governance is that today there is a problem of expert community-government cooperation. Today the government invites experts from abroad for the solution of any issue by taking loans and grants for this. The expert institute should significantly strengthen”, he said.Edited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"

We are exempting individual cab drivers from taxes, which means that their monthly revenue will increase by 12 thousand drams from that moment. We are willing to change the social benefits system in a way that even if the given individual is employed they won’t be reprieved from benefits. Meaning, we should encourage the work of these people,” he said.The government is also creating conditions for bootleggers to enter the legal arena and have the chance of selling and exporting alcoholic drinks of their production.The PM said the government is maximally facilitating regulations that are an obstacle for businesses.Pashinyan expressed certainty that the economic revolution in Armenia will triumph.

Today, we have important new products that will soon, I hope, be placed on serial production tracks, we have projects that are in final stages of discussion, we have projects that are under discussion, we have projects that are still ideas. I believe that Armenia must truly be a technologically advanced country, and we are headed this way,” Pashinyan said.As an example, he repeated a statement made earlier by him when he said they shouldn’t focus on having a tank, but the objective that will be solved by having it.“And we must understand what is this technology that will enable us solving this issue,” the PM said.“There was a time when in order to transfer information from one place to another people needed paper, a pen, an envelope, a post stamp, a mailman, a horse or a car for reaching the information quickly to its destination. If we were to continue focusing on the paper, the pen and the post stamp, there wouldn’t be any e-mail. And today, the same is done without paper, without a pen or stamp, even without a mailman or transportation, it is done more quickly and efficiently. Therefore, the mechanism of our thinking must undergo the kind of change that this itself will be placed at the foundation of development of our military-industry complex,” he said.Edited and translated by Stepan Kocharyan"

Armenia is exporting mainly products for final use, rather than raw materials to the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), Minister of economic development and investments Tigran Khachatryan said at the parliamentary standing committee on regional and Eurasian integration affairs, reports Armenpress.“The Eurasian Economic Union is the main part of our economic interests. Nearly 680 million USD out of the 2 billion 400 million USD goods exported from Armenia in 2018 have been exported to the EAEU states. And the most important is that we export goods for final use to the EAEU states and specifically Russia, rather than raw materials.

Armenia takes soft drinks under excise tax,"YEREVAN, FEBRUARY 28, ARMENPRESS. The Armenian government wants to introduce an excise tax on all types of soft drinks.According to officials, the additional tax collection will to some extent solve the budget loss problem that will be caused by the reduction of revenue tax rates and other reforms. Officials also argue that the move will also have a positive healthcare impact.Deputy Minister of Finance Arman Poghosyan told ARMENPRESS they first considered introducing the excise tax only on soft drinks that contain 5g or more sugar per 100gram of the ingredient.“Our initial recommendation was this, it was later revised. Now, an amended bill suggests an excise tax on all carbonated beverages, excluding mineral [soda] water and alcoholic drinks, regardless of sugar level. Our observations showed that tax administration based on sugar level can be accompanied by certain difficulties because the labels of the drinks rarely include sugar level, while carbonation is a more visible and more controllable element and tax administration can be implemented more effectively,” he said.Asked to elaborate on the goals of the bill, Poghosyan says on one hand its purpose is to provide additional tax revenue, and on the other hand it will limit ‘harmful consumption’. The deputy finance minister says carbonated drinks and beverages with high sugar levels are bad for health.According to Poghosyan, they conducted detailed discussions with the healthcare ministry and the World Health Organization while drafting the bill. He said they suggest having a fixed excise tax rate for all excisable soft drinks.It wasn’t immediately clear how the excise tax will impact the market prices of soft drinks in Armenia.The government is also currently developing a new tax code.Timeframes of commencing the new initiative weren't immediately clear.By Anna GrigoryanEdited and translated by Stepan Kocharyan"

Export volume from Armenia to EAEU grows: Deputy minister sees great opportunities in Eurasian market,"YEREVAN, FEBRUARY 13, ARMENPRESS. The market of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) has many advantages and is very important for Armenia in terms of export, and the emerging technical and other problems are immediately being solved by Armenia’s proposal. As a result, the trade turnover with the EAEU states increased 11.3% last year. The export volume from Armenia comprised 688 million 976 thousand drams, which is an increase of 20.7% compared to 2017, Albert Babayan – deputy minister of economy, said in an interview to ARMENPRESS.“Nearly 688 million AMD export share belongs to the EAEU market in Armenia’s export market. The same volume is exported to the EU market and nearly one billion to other markets. In other words, nearly 25-26% of export goes to the EAEU countries. Tobacco, drinks, shoes, textile, communication means, fresh fruits, vegetables, canned food, fresh fish and crayfish are mainly exported to the Eurasian market from Armenia. The most important is that we export ready-made goods to the EAEU states, rather than raw material”, the deputy minister said.According to the data of the National Statistical Committee, the trade turnover with the EAEU states in January-December 2018 comprised 1 billion 989 million 499.9 thousand drams, which increased by 11.3% compared to 2017.The deputy minister considers this export growth rate a positive figure and believes that it has a tendency to develop. Albert Babayan stated that it is necessary to use all the opportunities existing in the Eurasian market for carrying out export.The greatest export share belongs to Russia – 666 million 501.7 thousand USD. The deputy minister said this is linked with the fact that Russia traditionally has been Armenia’s greatest trade partner. “And this is also the reason that we are exporting goods with greater volumes to Russia. In addition, Russia’s market is more affordable from logistics perspective, it is bigger than that of the remaining EAEU states”, he noted.The trade turnover from the EAEU states has decreased only to Kyrgyzstan, as well as the export – by nearly 45%, comprising 970.5 thousand USD. “Maybe it was more appropriate to export that goods to the other markets. These goods are chocolate, drinks, fruits and vegetables. There are economic entities from Armenia who provide service in Kyrgyzstan, therefore we have no political obstacle with this country”, Babayan said.Talking about the trade turnover, export obstacles with the EAEU states, the deputy minister said export may cause technical problems for all member states. For instance, there is a restriction for exporting alcoholic drinks and tobacco from Armenia to Belarus which makes the entry of the goods to this market difficult. “But according to the results of the six months of 2018, we see that new goods have been exported which were not exported in the past. In order to overcome this obstacle Armenia has already submitted a proposal to the EAEU respective commission. The proposal is currently at the discussion stage”, the deputy minister said.Interview by Anna GrigoryanEdited and translated by Aneta Harutyunyan"
